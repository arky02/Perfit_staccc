- "My Model" Screen
  - Users can save more than 1 person's body dimensions into our app. We allow to make several model profiles and save their body sizes.(for the usage of their family, lovers ...etc)

# Techniques we used
### 1. PoseNet(Pose estimation)
- Pose estimation is the task of using an ML model to estimate the pose of a person from an image or a video by estimating the spatial locations of key body joints (keypoints).

 > We uses PoseNet to create a Virtual Model and extract body dimensions from it.  

### 2. OCR and OpenCV
- OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

 > We uses OCR and OpenCV to extract a clothes size by scanning a clothing's spec measurement.  

### 3. Designing Tools
- Adobe XD, Adobe Illustrator<br/>  

# Demo Video
#### Introduction for the demo video - we offer 2 versions to get measurements for the clothings while using 'PerFit' app.<br/>
Version 1 is the main version. It just allows automatic scanning for a clothing's spec measurement by using OCR technique.<br/>
But - We also made Version 2 for the unexpected errors while using 'Version 1 - scanning automatically by OCR'.<br/>
'Version 2 - using Mini-Perfit' let users to input clothing's dimensional sizes manually. Users can just simply enter clothes sizes into a floating widget, Mini-Perfit.<br/>

> 1) Version 1 - Using OCR
