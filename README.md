- "My Model" Screen
  Users can save more than 1 person's body dimensions into our app. We allow to make several model profiles and save their body sizes.(for the usage of their family, lovers..etc)

# Techniques
### 1. PoseNet(Pose estimation)
- Pose estimation is the task of using an ML model to estimate the pose of a person from an image or a video by estimating the spatial locations of key body joints (keypoints).

 > PerFit uses PoseNet to create a Virtual Model and extract body dimensions from it.
<br>

### 2. OCR and OpenCV
- OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

 > PerFit uses OCR and OpenCV to extract a clothes size by scanning a clothing's spec measurement.
<br>

### 3. Designing Programms: Adobe XD, Adobe Illustrator

# Demo Video
Before watching the demo video;we offer 2 versions to get measurements for the clothings while using 'PerFit' app.
Version 1 is the main version. It just allows automatic scanning for a clothing's spec measurement by using OCR technique.
But- We also made Version 2 for the unexpected errors while using Version 1: scanning automatically by OCR.
Version 2: using Mini-Perfit let users to input clothing's dimensional sizes manually. Users can just simply enter clothes sizes into a floating widget, Mini-Perfit.

1) Version 1 - Using OCR

2) Version 2 - Using Mini-Perfit
