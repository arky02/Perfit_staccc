# Techniques
1. PoseNet(Pose estimation)
- Pose estimation is the task of using an ML model to estimate the pose of a person from an image or a video by estimating the spatial locations of key body joints (keypoints).

  PerFit uses PoseNet to create a Virtual Model and extract body dimensions from it.

2. OCR and OpenCV
- OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

  PerFit uses OCR and OpenCV to extract a clothes size by scanning a clothing's spec measurement.


3. Designing Programms: Adobe XD, Adobe Illustrator
